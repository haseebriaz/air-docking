# Docking Adobe Air window with Openfin window.

This is a simple and bare minimum demo demonstrating how to dock an Air window to an Openfin window.


## How to run

 1) Download the [Air project](http://haseebriaz.github.io/air-docking/OpenFinDockTest.zip) packed in a zip file.

 2) Extract the project files on to the disk and set it up as an air project.

 3) Add the opefinAirAdapter.swc and OpenfinNativeExtention.ane as dependencies.

 4) Build and Run the project. Which will then launch this very simple html app in Openfin  and once its launched
 and connected you will be able to see some debug traces. At this point the Air app will group/dock itself to the Openfin app.
